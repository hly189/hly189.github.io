				<h2>I am believer in automation</h2>
				Hi there, I am Hoa Ly. I love leveraging technologies to get things done, instead of doing it manually.  From the day I found fun with automation, it's my passion. I started exploring the world of automation. With more proper external training and knowledge from UC Berkeley, I learn that automation is not about websites and servers. I advanced my skill and started building tool to extract data from database and load them into designated area. 
				
				<h2>Philosophy</h2>
				I believed that sharing is caring. So, that is why I share most of my source-code on my <a href="https://github.com/hly189">Github</a>. Therefore, feel free to check them out.

				I'm friendly, believe it or not. People who don't know my think I'm silient, people who know me wish I was :)
			
				<h2>Beside Automation... What else ?</h2>
				I am also learning how to trade and invest in stock. It is fun to look at the market and predict whenever the market goes up or down. In general, if you can understand the behavior of pattern in the market, you can estimate the its direction.
